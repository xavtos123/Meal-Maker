# Meal-Maker

As a frequent diner, I love trying out new restaurants and experimenting with different foods. However, having to figure out what I want to order can be a time-consuming ordeal if the menu is big, and I want an easier way to be able to figure out what I are going to eat.

In this project,I will use JavaScript to randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu. I’ll keep running it until we’re satisfied with the generated meal!
